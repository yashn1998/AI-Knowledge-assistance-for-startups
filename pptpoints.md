Got it — now we’ll do the same structured breakdown for evidence_validator_agent.py that you shared in the screenshots. This agent is meant to validate evidence extracted from the case signature and ensure it passes certain checks before being used further in the pipeline.

How It Works (Flow)

1. Input

YAML configuration file (contains keywords and rules to check).

State object (already enriched by the previous agent, e.g., case signature JSON, metadata, extracted fields).



---

2. Strict Key Check (_check_strict_keys)

Takes yaml_data and response.signature_json.

Extracts keys from the YAML (Keyword field).

Validates if all required keys exist in the case signature JSON.

Output: returns True if all keys are present, else False.

If missing keys → audit logs "Key Not Found" and execution ends.



---

3. Exclusion Check (_matches_exclusion)

Defines signature prompts (symptom_phenotype, affected_entity_layer, trigger_operating_context, scope_recurrence).

Iterates through each signature key:

Compares user-provided values (from case signature JSON) against system prompts.

Calls execute_model to compute similarity/validation score.


Accumulates a confidence score.

If average score < threshold (6/10) → marks case as excluded.

Output:

Returns True if evidence passes.

Otherwise, sets state.exclusion_reason = "Confidence score too low" and ends execution.

4. Scoring Evidence (_score_evidence)

Currently returns 1.0 (dummy score), but logically intended for implementing deeper scoring logic later.



---

5. Main Execution (__call__)

Logs entry: "Entering Evidence Validator Agent".

Loads YAML config.

Runs checks sequentially:

1. Strict key validation → fail ends pipeline.


2. Exclusion check → if matched, evidence is invalid.


3. Scoring evidence → assigns a score.


4. Marks evidence as valid (state.evidence_ok = True) if score ≥ 0.6.



Audits results with "END" (failure) or "OK" (success).

Returns updated state object containing:

Evidence validity status.

Confidence score.

Exclusion reason (if any).

Input → Processing → Output

Inputs

YAML config file (validation rules & keywords).

Case signature JSON (from previous agent).


Processing

Validate mandatory keys.

Run exclusion checks using prompts + model scoring.

Compute evidence score.

Audit results.


Outputs

Evidence status (valid or invalid).

Evidence score (numeric).

Exclusion reason (if applicable).

Updated state object.

PPT-Friendly Diagram Flow

1. Inputs

YAML config

Case signature JSON



2. Check Keys

Ensure required keys exist



3. Exclusion Validation

Compare user signature vs system prompts

LLM scoring for similarity

Threshold-based decision



4. Evidence Scoring

Assign confidence score

≥ 0.6 → Valid evidence

< 0.6 → Excluded



5. Outputs

Evidence validity status

Score

Exclusion reason (if any)

Updated state

This mirrors the explanation style you wanted for the case intake agent.

Do you want me to also draw the flow diagram (like we did before with arrows) so you can drop it into your PPT directly?
