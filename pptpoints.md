Got it — now we’ll do the same structured breakdown for evidence_validator_agent.py that you shared in the screenshots. This agent is meant to validate evidence extracted from the case signature and ensure it passes certain checks before being used further in the pipeline.


---

How It Works (Flow)

1. Input

YAML configuration file (contains keywords and rules to check).

State object (already enriched by the previous agent, e.g., case signature JSON, metadata, extracted fields).



---

2. Strict Key Check (_check_strict_keys)

Takes yaml_data and response.signature_json.

Extracts keys from the YAML (Keyword field).

Validates if all required keys exist in the case signature JSON.

Output: returns True if all keys are present, else False.

If missing keys → audit logs "Key Not Found" and execution ends.



---

3. Exclusion Check (_matches_exclusion)

Defines signature prompts (symptom_phenotype, affected_entity_layer, trigger_operating_context, scope_recurrence).

Iterates through each signature key:

Compares user-provided values (from case signature JSON) against system prompts.

Calls execute_model to compute similarity/validation score.


Accumulates a confidence score.

If average score < threshold (6/10) → marks case as excluded.

Output:

Returns True if evidence passes.

Otherwise, sets state.exclusion_reason = "Confidence score too low" and ends execution.




---

4. Scoring Evidence (_score_evidence)

Currently returns 1.0 (dummy score), but logically intended for implementing deeper scoring logic later.



---

5. Main Execution (__call__)

Logs entry: "Entering Evidence Validator Agent".

Loads YAML config.

Runs checks sequentially:

1. Strict key validation → fail ends pipeline.


2. Exclusion check → if matched, evidence is invalid.


3. Scoring evidence → assigns a score.


4. Marks evidence as valid (state.evidence_ok = True) if score ≥ 0.6.



Audits results with "END" (failure) or "OK" (success).

Returns updated state object containing:

Evidence validity status.

Confidence score.

Exclusion reason (if any).




---

Input → Processing → Output

Inputs

YAML config file (validation rules & keywords).

Case signature JSON (from previous agent).


Processing

Validate mandatory keys.

Run exclusion checks using prompts + model scoring.

Compute evidence score.

Audit results.


Outputs

Evidence status (valid or invalid).

Evidence score (numeric).

Exclusion reason (if applicable).

Updated state object.

PPT-Friendly Diagram Flow

1. Inputs

YAML config

Case signature JSON



2. Check Keys

Ensure required keys exist



3. Exclusion Validation

Compare user signature vs system prompts

LLM scoring for similarity

Threshold-based decision



4. Evidence Scoring

Assign confidence score

≥ 0.6 → Valid evidence

< 0.6 → Excluded



5. Outputs

Evidence validity status

Score

Exclusion reason (if any)

Updated state

This mirrors the explanation style you wanted for the case intake agent.

Do you want me to also draw the flow diagram (like we did before with arrows) so you can drop it into your PPT directly?










-----------+++++++---+------+&-------&&+((((()----



Perfect, let’s turn this into something clean and slide-worthy. I’ll walk through what the code in your screenshots is doing, then structure it into PPT-ready talking points you can use when explaining.

Code Overview

The file case_intake_agent.py defines an agent class (CaseIntakeNormalizeAgent) that processes input case files, generates a normalized “case signature,” and enriches the state object with structured data for downstream tasks.


---

How It Works (Flow)

1. Input files

Case header file (contains case details with IDs, numbers, etc.)

Return data file (contains product/family mappings and related metadata).


2. Preprocessing step (read_and_preprocess_data)

Reads CSV input files.

Normalizes data types (e.g., case_number converted to string).

Merges case header data with return data on case_number.

Cleans duplicates → ensures unique case records.


3. Case signature generation (generate_case_signature)

Builds a dictionary with essential case details:

Problem description.

Customer symptoms.


Passes this dict into a prompt → LLM model call (execute_model).

Gets a normalized JSON "case signature."

Tracks token usage (monitoring cost/length of prompt).

Audits the event → logs what was generated.


4. Main execution (__call__)

Starts by logging entry: "Entering Case Intake Normalization Agent".

If case signature is missing:

Calls generate_case_signature.

Extracts symptoms, keywords, problem details, evidence, inferences, case summary.

Populates into state object.


If metadata is missing:

Adds product family, product ID, and RMA (Return Material Authorization) date into the state.


Audits completion with "signature_ready".


5. Output

Returns updated state object containing:

Normalized case signature JSON.

Extracted structured fields (symptoms, evidence, problem details).

Case metadata (product family, ID, RMA date).

PPT Slide Points

Slide 1: Objective

Automate normalization of case intake data.

Standardize case signatures for downstream analysis.

Reduce manual effort and ensure structured case insights.


Slide 2: Inputs

Case Header CSV → contains case IDs, descriptions.

Return Data CSV → contains product/family metadata.


Slide 3: Processing Steps

Read & preprocess CSV files.

Merge case header and return data by case number.

Clean duplicates and normalize data.

Generate structured "Case Signature" using LLM.

Extract key details (symptoms, problems, keywords, evidence).


Slide 4: Outputs

JSON case signature with:

Problem description.

Customer symptoms.

Extracted insights.


Metadata: product family, product ID, RMA date.

Enriched state object ready for downstream workflows.


Slide 5: Benefits

Faster case normalization.

Standardized structured outputs.

Traceable logs with auditing.

Integration with LLMs for intelligent extraction.

This way, when you present, you can show:

1. Input → Processing → Output → Benefits.


2. Back it with one or two sample JSON outputs for clarity.



Would you like me to also draft a visual flow diagram (Input → Preprocess → Generate Case Signature → Output) that you can drop directly into PPT?
