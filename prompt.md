Got it — here’s a clean, deployment-ready reference architecture that implements the exact flow in your image (Intake → Feature Engg → Triage → Issue Creation → FA/RCA → CLCA → Monitoring with a knowledge feedback loop).

1. Component map (what each block does)



Sources (DB / SR / Logs / Telemetry / KB)

Service Requests, crash dumps, OBFL, telemetry streams, prior RCA/KB.

CIN–EVR–SUM (Intake & Normalization)

Validate evidence, normalize formats, de-dupe, create a Case Signature.

LTP (Feature Engineering)

Parse logs & telemetry, derive metadata, compute embeddings.

Triage

Known-issue matcher, similarity search & trending, VFA decision + handoff.

Issue Creation

Create/Update issue, set state, link components & owners.

Physical FA & RCA

Guided fault isolation/duplication; capture root cause; publish RCA report + components impacted.

CLCA Agent

Proposes Containment → Mitigation → Corrective → Preventive actions; outputs action plan & owners.

Monitoring

Track effectiveness & field impact; dashboards; KPIs.

Knowledge loop

All outcomes feed back to KB + embeddings to improve future classification/matching.

2. Azure-native reference architecture (services & data flow)



Ingestion & Transport

Event & file intake: API Management + App Service (SR/attachments), Event Hubs (telemetry), Storage Queues/Blob (logs, dumps).

Schema/contract: Azure Schema Registry (in Event Hubs) + JSON/Avro.

Intake & Normalization (CIN–EVR–SUM)

Azure Functions / AKS microservices:

Evidence checks, PII redaction, format normalization.

Case Signature generator (hash of key features).

State & metadata: Cosmos DB (cases, signatures), Blob (raw artifacts).

Feature Engineering (LTP)

Databricks / Synapse Spark for parsing logs & deriving features.

Azure OpenAI embeddings + Azure AI Search (Vector Store) for vectorized case/issue KB.

Feature store: Delta Lake on ADLS Gen2.

Triage

“Known Matcher” service (AKS) does:

Exact match (Case Signature) via Cosmos DB.

Similarity + trend via Azure AI Search vector queries + Kusto (ADX) for trends.

Decisioning: Rules + small policy models (Azure ML managed endpoints).

Issue Creation

Workflow service (Logic Apps/Functions) creates/updates issues in Azure DevOps/Jira.

Graph links: Components (CMDB in Cosmos/SQL), owners (AAD groups).

Physical FA & RCA

Lab/bench integration microservice (AKS) to capture duplication/isolation steps.

RCA workbench (Databricks/Notebooks) writes RCA report objects to Blob + metadata to Cosmos.

Component impact graph stored in Azure Cosmos DB Gremlin or Neo4j (on AKS).

CLCA Agent (Actioning)

Orchestrator (LangGraph/AutoGen on AKS) with Azure OpenAI (GPT) tools:

Generates containment/mitigation/corrective/preventive plan.

Calls enterprise tools (Change Mgmt, CMDB, DevOps) via Logic Apps connectors.

Plans & approvals recorded in DevOps/Jira + Cosmos.

Monitoring & Feedback

Telemetry & impact: Azure Data Explorer (ADX) + Application Insights.

Dashboards: Power BI (effectiveness, MTTR, recurrence rate, field failure rate).

Feedback loop:

New Issues/RCA/Plans are chunked → embedded → upserted to Azure AI Search.

Feature store & rules retrained in Azure ML pipelines (triggered by Data Factory).

Cross-cutting

Identity & RBAC: Entra ID (AAD), Managed Identities.

Secrets: Key Vault.

CI/CD: GitHub Actions/Azure DevOps Pipelines.

Observability: Azure Monitor + Log Analytics; OpenTelemetry from services.

Governance: Purview (data lineage), Defender for Cloud (posture).

4. Data contracts & stores (quick spec)



Case: {case_id, signature, src_refs[], submitter, created_at, normalized_artifacts[], features[], embeddings[], triage_decision, issue_ref, state}

Stored in Cosmos DB; artifacts in ADLS Gen2; embeddings in Azure AI Search.

Issue: {issue_id, title, description, linked_cases[], component_refs[], owners[], status, devops_ref}

RCA Report: {rca_id, issue_id, root_cause, evidence_refs[], components_impacted[], corrective_actions[], created_by, created_at}

Action Plan: {plan_id, issue_id, actions[{type, owner, due, status}], approvals[]}

Metrics (ADX): MTTR, recurrence rate, post-fix failure trend, field failure delta.


---

5. Eventing & orchestration



Buses/Topics (Service Bus):

case.created, case.normalized, features.ready, triage.ready,

issue.created|updated, rca.published, clca.plan.published,

monitoring.kpi.updated.

Orchestration: Durable Functions for long-running flows (retry, compensation).


---

6. Security & compliance



Private endpoints for AI Search, Storage, Cosmos, Key Vault.

Network isolation with Hub-Spoke VNets; AKS with Azure CNI, NSGs.

Data classification with Purview; audit logs to Log Analytics.

Customer-managed keys (CMK) for Storage/AI Search/DBs where required.


---

7. How this implements the flow



Intake → Feature Engg → Triage occurs in near-real time via Event Hubs/Service Bus and AKS/Functions.

Issue Creation pushes to DevOps; Physical FA/RCA is captured and versioned.

CLCA Agent (Azure OpenAI + tools) generates actionable plans and opens/updates work items.

Monitoring closes the loop with ADX + Power BI, and all outcomes are embedded back into AI Search to improve the next classification.

If you want, I can drop this into a printable one-pager (with a cloud diagram + data flow) or tailor it to AWS/GCP. Want me to turn the Mermaid into a PNG and a PPT slide?
