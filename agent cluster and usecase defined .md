Problem statement

The RMA issue handling process is slow, error-prone and not scalable: too many RMAs require manual triage and physical failure analysis (FA), knowledge updates are delayed or inconsistent, and teams lack automated, data-driven triage and impact assessment—resulting in long resolution times, wasted physical FA capacity, missed trending issues, and poor feedback into the knowledge base.

Why this is a problem (symptoms)

Many SR/RMA entries need manual investigation (notes, log snippets) and manual entry into tracking systems in early phases.

Physical FA is a bottleneck (limited lab capacity, long lead times) because virtual triage can’t reliably isolate many faults.

Knowledge base (KIDB) updates lag or are inconsistent, so known issues get re-triaged.

Intermittent / random faults are hard to reproduce and often escape corrective action.

Trend detection is weak — by the time trending is recognized, many field units are impacted.

Reports and RCFA outputs are not digitized or standardized, harming reuse and automation.

Human errors and inconsistent logging make automated ML/AI approaches less reliable.


Root causes

Incomplete or poorly structured telemetry/OBFL data ingestion and normalization.

Lack of automated, reliable similarity/known-issue matching and cluster detection.

Poor integration between virtual FA, KIDB, and downstream CLCA/RCA workflows.

No consistent template/digitization for FA/RCFA artifacts.

Insufficient agentic automation to continuously update knowledge and trigger containment actions.


Business impact (what’s at stake)

Increased RMA cycle times and higher cost-per-RMA (shipping, lab time, manpower).

Slower time-to-corrective-action → larger field population exposure, higher AFR and customer dissatisfaction.

Inefficient use of expensive physical FA resources.

Lost learning: recurring issues not prevented because KB/AFR not updated timely.

Management lacks near-real-time, data-driven decision inputs for containment and product-change decisions.


Desired outcome / success criteria

Large reduction in RMAs routed to physical FA through reliable Virtual FA triage.

Faster detection of trending issues and automated creation/updating of KIDB entries and AFR.

Shorter end-to-end resolution time (triage → CA confirmation).

High-quality, digitized RCFA/FA artifacts that feed ML models and the knowledge base.

Automated cluster/known-issue matching with explainable confidence scores so human review is focused only where needed.

If you want, I can turn this into a one-line executive problem statement for a slide, or map these pain points to the proposed agent architecture (which agents solve which root causes). Which would you like next?

Perfect — let’s analyze Image 1 (VFA Process) as the solution architecture to the problem we just defined.


---

🔎 Breakdown of the Proposed Solution (Image 1 – VFA Process)

The diagram shows how the Virtual Failure Analysis (VFA) process is automated using agents + AI/ML to reduce manual triage, improve knowledge updates, and accelerate corrective actions.


---

1. Case Intake & Normalization Agent

Inputs: SR details, syslogs, case notes.

Action: Cleans, parses, and normalizes unstructured data into a Case Signature + Case Summary (JSON).

Value: Removes dependency on manual log reading and note summarization → eliminates human error and saves analyst time.

Fixes problem of: inconsistent inputs and missing data standardization.



---

2. Evidence Validator & HW Exclusion Check

Inputs: HW exclusion details (e.g., known hardware not needing analysis).

Action: Ensures evidence is valid; screens out irrelevant hardware cases.

Value: Prevents waste of FA cycles on known exclusions or low-confidence evidence.

Fixes problem of: unnecessary load on FA teams.



---

3. Known Issue Matcher & Trending

Action: Matches the case signature against Known Issue Signatures (KIDB).

Decision: If a match is found above a threshold → directly flagged as a known issue.

Value: Avoids re-triaging repeat issues, updates trending stats, reduces duplication.

Fixes problem of: recurring known issues consuming resources.



---

4. Cluster Similarity (Unknown Issues)

Action: For unknown issues, compares with existing clusters of similar cases.

Decision:

Yes, similar → case is added to existing cluster.

No match → flagged as a new cluster.


Value: Early detection of trending issues before they escalate into field impact.

Fixes problem of: slow recognition of new or trending failures.



---

5. Cluster Updation Agent

Action: Updates cluster database when new clusters are detected.

Value: Keeps knowledge continuously updated with minimal human involvement.

Fixes problem of: outdated or lagging KB updates.



---

6. Handover Decision & Summarized Reports

Action: Consolidates case outcomes (known issue, new cluster, or exclusion) and generates decision-ready reports.

Outputs:

Mitigation plan.

Case-level outputs for downstream workflows (e.g., RCA, CLCA, corrective actions).


Value: Ensures decision-makers (engineering, manufacturing, design) get structured, summarized inputs.

Fixes problem of: manual reporting, unstructured RCFA data, and loss of information.

---

👉 In simple terms: Image 1 solution creates an AI/agent-driven triage pipeline that automates what used to be manual, slow, and error-prone, while continuously feeding the knowledge base and downstream corrective action processes.


---

Would you like me to now map Image 1 (solution) directly against the RMA Issue Process Flow (Images 2 & 3) step by step — showing exactly where the agents slot in? That will give you a full “as-is vs to-be” view.




Got it ✅
You want me to cluster the agents from Image 1 (VFA solution) into 3 logical parts, where one cluster will demonstrate the Issue Creation Agent in depth (similar to the missing “Image 4” in your flow).

Let’s break this down.


---

🔗 Step 1: Cluster the Agents into 3 Groups

From Image 1 (VFA Process), we have 6 main agent-driven components.
We’ll group them into 3 logical clusters that map to the RMA Issue Process flow (Images 2 & 3).


---

Cluster 1 – Intake & Validation Agents

Case Intake & Normalization Agent (Step 1)

Evidence Validator & HW Exclusion Check (Step 2)


👉 Purpose: Convert raw SR/syslog/case data into normalized case signatures and filter out irrelevant hardware.
📌 Outcome: A clean, validated case signature ready for issue matching.


---

Cluster 2 – Issue Creation Agent (Core Focus)

Known Issue Matcher & Trending (Step 3)

Cluster Similarity (Step 4)

Cluster Updation Agent (Step 5)


👉 Purpose: Identify whether the case maps to:

A known issue (→ update KIDB, trending stats, AFR).

A similar cluster (→ group with existing issue cluster).

A new cluster (→ create a new issue in the system).


📌 Outcome: A formalized issue profile (new or updated) → This is what we call the Issue Creation Agent.


---

Cluster 3 – Decision & Reporting Agents

Handover Decision & Summarized Reports (Step 6)


👉 Purpose: Generate structured outputs for downstream workflows (RCA, CLCA, corrective actions, AFR monitoring).
📌 Outcome: Decision-ready artifacts & reports.


---

🔎 Step 2: Deep Dive – Issue Creation Agent (Cluster 2)

This is the heart of automation, where the case transitions from “just data” into a formal issue entry in the RMA Issue Flow.


---

A. Inputs

Normalized Case Signature (JSON)

Known Issue Signatures (from KB/KIDB)

Unknown Issue Signature DB (clusters of past issues)



---

B. Core Steps

1. Known Issue Matching

Use AI/ML similarity scoring against stored Known Issue Signatures.

If confidence ≥ threshold → tag as Known Issue.

Update: KIDB, trending dashboards, AFR metrics.



2. Cluster Similarity Analysis

If not a known issue → compare against clusters of unknown issues.

If similarity ≥ threshold → join existing cluster (marks it as part of an ongoing/trending issue).



3. New Cluster Detection

If no match → case is flagged as a New Cluster.

Trigger Cluster Updation Agent to:

Create a new cluster profile.

Assign unique cluster ID.

Store as “(pre-)Issue Creation” entry in the KB.






---

C. Outputs

Known Issue Case → Issue update (with AFR, trend stats).

Trending Issue Case → Cluster size + impact updated, feeds monitoring.

New Issue Case → Formal Issue Profile created (pre-Issue Creation → Issue Creation in Image 2 flow).



---

D. Value Added

Automates the Issue Creation step (Image 2, Step 2).

Prevents duplicate or redundant issue creation.

Enables early detection of trending issues.

Keeps KIDB fresh with continuous updates.



---

E. Example Walkthrough

1. SR created → Case normalized.


2. Evidence valid → Passed to Issue Creation Agent.


3. Agent checks DB:

If it matches an old PSU failure pattern → Known Issue, update AFR.

If 10 similar “fan control” cases cluster → Trending Issue, issue flagged.

If a brand-new log pattern appears → New Cluster, Issue Profile auto-created in KIDB.

✅ In summary:

Cluster 1: Prepares the data.

Cluster 2 (Issue Creation Agent): Decides → Known / Trending / New issue and creates/updates issue profiles.

Cluster 3: Reports and hands off decisions to downstream FA/RCA processes.



---

Do you want me to map Cluster 2 (Issue Creation Agent) directly into the RMA Issue Process Flow (Image 2) to show exactly where this automation replaces manual “Issue Creation / Trending / Critical Issue flagging”?



Perfect 👍 Let’s now define Cluster 1 – Intake & Validation Agents in depth, just like we did for Cluster 2 (Issue Creation Agent).


---

🔗 Cluster 1 – Intake & Validation Agents

This cluster is the front door of the VFA process.
It ensures all incoming Service Requests (SRs), system logs, and case notes are converted into a clean, normalized, and validated case signature before any downstream issue matching or creation happens.

It consists of:

1. Case Intake & Normalization Agent


2. Evidence Validator & HW Exclusion Agent




---

1. Case Intake & Normalization Agent

Purpose:

Convert raw, heterogeneous inputs (SR details, syslogs, case notes) into a structured format.

Generate a Case Signature + Case Summary (JSON).


Key Functions:

Parse unstructured logs and notes.

Apply NLP/ML models to summarize and extract fault symptoms.

Normalize terminology (e.g., “power failure”, “PSU fault” → standardized tags).

Create a fingerprint/signature of the case that can be compared downstream.


Outputs:

Case Signature (JSON) → includes metadata, error codes, device type, timestamp, symptom summary.

Stored in DB for reuse by multiple teams.


Problems it solves:

Eliminates manual log reading and inconsistent note-taking.

Provides machine-comparable format for issue detection.

Prevents missing critical evidence during intake.



---

2. Evidence Validator & HW Exclusion Agent

Purpose:

Ensure the evidence attached to the SR is sufficient and relevant.

Exclude hardware issues that should not go through VFA (false positives, non-RMA cases).


Key Functions:

Cross-check logs against HW Exclusion DB (e.g., cosmetic defects, already-known HW-only issues).

Confidence scoring: discard cases with low evidence confidence (e.g., incomplete logs).

Flag missing/invalid data back to intake.


Outputs:

Pass → case moves to Issue Creation Agent (Cluster 2).

Fail (Low confidence / HW exclusion) → end process (case rejected or flagged for manual review).


Problems it solves:

Avoids wasting resources on cases with insufficient or irrelevant evidence.

Reduces load on downstream clustering and FA.

Increases trust in automation by filtering noise early.



---

📊 Flow Representation (Cluster 1)

Inputs: SR Details + Syslogs + Case Notes
                │
   ┌────────────┴─────────────┐
   │ Case Intake &            │
   │ Normalization Agent      │
   └────────────┬─────────────┘
                │ (Case Signature JSON)
   ┌────────────┴─────────────┐
   │ Evidence Validator &     │
   │ HW Exclusion Agent       │
   └────────────┬─────────────┘
                │
     Pass ──────┴──────→ Cluster 2 (Issue Creation Agent)
     Fail ─────────────→ End Process (Low confidence / HW exclusion)


---

Business Value of Cluster 1

Data Quality Gatekeeper → ensures only clean, valid inputs go into downstream analysis.

Reduces noise → irrelevant SRs or HW-only cases filtered out.

Saves analyst time → no more manual summarization of logs/notes.

Enables automation → by creating standardized case signatures.



---

✅ In summary:
Cluster 1 (Intake & Validation Agents) is the foundation of the VFA solution.
It converts messy, unstructured SR data into clean, validated, structured case signatures, ensuring downstream automation (Cluster 2: Issue Creation Agent, Cluster 3: Decision/Reporting) runs on high-quality, trustworthy inputs.


---

Would you like me to now define Cluster 3 (Decision & Reporting Agent) in the same deep-dive style, so you’ll have a complete picture of all 3 clusters?



Nice — here’s a focused, deep, implementation-ready spec for Cluster 2 — Issue Creation Agent. I’ll cover architecture, data, algorithms, confidence & explainability, human-in-loop flows, APIs, monitoring/KPIs, and an MVP rollout plan you can act on.

Cluster 2 — Issue Creation Agent (Deep Dive)

Goal: convert a validated Case Signature (JSON) into either (A) a Known Issue update, (B) an assignment to an existing cluster (trending issue), or (C) creation of a new issue cluster — automatically, reliably, auditable, and explainable.


---

1) Logical components (micro-services / modules)

1. Feature Extractor

Turns Case Signature into model-ready features: structured fields, tokenized text, embeddings, categorical encodings.



2. Known-Issue Matcher (Exact/Approx)

Fast rule-based matching + embedding similarity against known issue signatures.



3. Cluster Similarity Engine

Compares case to existing unknown clusters using vector similarity + metadata heuristics.



4. Decision Engine

Applies thresholds, rules, business logic to decide Known / Cluster-match / New-cluster. Emits confidence & explainability bundle.



5. Cluster Updater / Creator

Creates or updates cluster records, maintains lineage, increments counts / stats, triggers KIDB/Audit updates.



6. Human-In-Loop Orchestrator

Routes low-confidence or high-impact cases to UI for human review; supports accept/reject/merge.



7. Audit & Explainability Store

Stores neighbor examples, similarity scores, feature contributions and decision rationale.



8. API / Notification Layer

Exposes endpoints: /match, /create-issue, /review-result, and publishes events to queues for downstream consumers.



9. Model Management & Retraining

Data pipeline to collect labeled outcomes and retrain matching/clustering models.





---

2) Inputs & outputs

Input: CaseSignature (JSON) — example fields below.

{
  "case_id": "SR-2025-000123",
  "device_type": "ISR4451",

  "attachments": ["obfl1.bin","log1.txt"],
  "confidence_meta": {"log_coverage":0.7}
}

Outputs: decision object with decision_type, confidence, explainability, and actions.

{
  "case_id":"SR-2025-000123",
  "decision_type":"KNOWN_ISSUE", // KNOWN_ISSUE | CLUSTER_MATCH | NEW_CLUSTER | REVIEW_REQUIRED
  "match_id":"KIDB-PSU-2019-001",
  "confidence":0.91,
  "explainability":{
     "top_features": [{"feature":"error_codes","weight":0.45}, {"feature":"embedding_sim","weight":0.35}],
     "nearest_examples":[{"case":"SR-2019-345","sim":0.94}, ...]
  },
  "actions":[ "update_kidb", "increment_afr"]
}


---

3) Matching & similarity algorithms

Known-Issue Matcher (two-stage)

1. Deterministic rules / signature match (fast): exact error code match, device+firmware combination, signature hash match → immediate known hit.


2. Vector-based semantic match: text + log embeddings (sentence-transformer) against KIDB signature embeddings.

Similarity metric: cosine similarity.

Suggested heuristic: if deterministic fails and cos_sim >= 0.85 → Known Issue candidate.




Cluster Similarity Engine

Represent clusters by:

Centroid embedding (mean of embeddings of member cases)

Signature tokens set (e.g., error codes, device types)

Temporal & geo metadata (recentness, region)


Similarity score = weighted sum: w1 * cos_sim(embeddings) + w2 * token_overlap + w3 * metadata_match.

Suggested initial weights: w1=0.6, w2=0.3, w3=0.1 (tune later).


Thresholds:

>= 0.80 → auto-assign to cluster (if cluster size above minimum and not flagged critical).

0.60 - 0.80 → route to review.

< 0.60 → candidate for new cluster.



New-cluster detection

If no existing cluster passes review threshold, create new cluster with:

cluster_id, centroid embedding, initial members = [case], status = PRE_ISSUE.


Optionally apply batching: if N similar new clusters appear in short window → auto-promote to trending.



---

4) Confidence scoring & explainability

Confidence computed as composite: conf = sigmoid(a * similarity + b * rule_score + c * evidence_quality) (map to 0..1).

Explainability:

Return top contributing features (error codes, firmware mismatch, keywords).

Show nearest known issue examples (IDs + similarity).

Produce short natural-language rationale for the decision (e.g., “Matched KIDB PSU thermal fault: err codes X,Y; sim 0.92”).


Store explanation snapshot in Audit store for compliance.



---

5) Human-in-loop & escalation rules

Auto-route to human review when:

Confidence between 0.60 and 0.85 (tunable).

Case marked critical (safety, regulatory).

New cluster size < X but affecting high-value customers.


Review UI features:

Show case details, matching clusters, nearest examples, suggested tags, ability to merge clusters or mark false positive.

Buttons: Accept auto-decision, Edit & Accept, Reject & Send to Manual Triage, Merge with specified cluster, Create RCA case.


SLA: reviewers decide within configured time window (e.g., 4h for critical, 24h for non-critical).



---

6) Data & storage model / versioning

KIDB (Known Issues DB): signatures, canonical embedding, version, AFR numbers, linked CLCA tags.

Cluster Store: cluster_id, centroid_embedding, members[], created_at, last_updated, status, aggregate_metrics (size, trend rate), owner/team.

Case History / Audit: immutable log of decisions, reviewer actions, timestamps, model versions used.

Model metadata: model_id, embedding_model_version, threshold config, training snapshot link.



---

7) API contract (core endpoints)

POST /match -> input CaseSignature -> returns Decision object.

POST /cluster/create -> create cluster (internal/admin).

GET /cluster/{id} -> fetch cluster metadata + examples.

POST /review/{case_id} -> submit human decision.

Event bus topics: case.matched, cluster.created, kidb.updated.



---

8) Monitoring, metrics & KPIs

Automation rate: % of cases auto-resolved as Known or Cluster without human review.

Precision@auto: fraction of auto-assigned cases that were later validated as correct.

False-positive rate: % of cases auto-matched to wrong known issue or cluster.

Time-to-issue-creation: median time from SR to issue profile creation.

Cluster growth rate: newly created clusters per week + time to trend promotion.

Reviewer load: queue size, average decision latency.

Model drift indicators: drop in similarity scores over time, rising human overrides.


Alerting:

Spike in new-cluster creations (possible new widespread failure).

Drop in automation precision below threshold.

Backlog of reviews exceeding SLA.



---

9) MLOps & retraining

Collect labeled pairs: (case, final_decision) and reviewer feedback.

Periodic retrain cadence: weekly for embedding model fine-tune (if resources), monthly for production retraining.

A/B test new thresholds and models against baseline automation precision/recall.

Keep a gold set for regression tests (historical confirmed clusters and known issues).



---

10) Security, privacy & compliance

Logs and OBFL may contain sensitive / PII. Ensure:

Data encryption at rest and in transit.

Access control (role-based) for reviewer UI and API.

Audit trails for all automated actions and human overrides.

Pseudonymization where required.




---

11) Scalability & deployment notes

Use message queue (Kafka/RabbitMQ) for ingestion and eventing.

Feature Extractor and Matching engine are horizontally scalable stateless services.

Store embeddings in a vector index (FAISS, Milvus, or cloud equivalent) for fast nearest neighbors.

Cluster store and KIDB on an RDBMS/NoSQL depending on query patterns; maintain cache for hot clusters.

Graceful degradation: if vector search unavailable, fall back to rule-based matching and mark decision confidence low.



---

12) Example decision flow (sequence)

1. POST /match with CaseSignature.


2. Feature Extractor produces embedding + tokens.


3. Deterministic signature lookup → no hit.


4. Vector search nearest KIDB signatures → best sim 0.78 (< known threshold).


5. Vector search against cluster index → best cluster sim 0.83 (>= cluster threshold). Decision Engine sets CLUSTER_MATCH, confidence 0.82.


6. Because confidence in review window [0.60,0.85] -> route to Review queue + publish case.needs_review.


7. Reviewer accepts -> system updates cluster member list; cluster centroid recomputed; KIDB unaffected.




---

13) Sample tuning & threshold suggestions (startpoints)

Deterministic exact-match rules first.

Known-issue semantic threshold: ≥ 0.85 auto-assign.

Cluster auto-assign threshold: ≥ 0.80.

Review window: 0.60 - 0.85.

Critical override: any case flagged critical by upstream -> force review.


(These are starting values — tune using A/B tests on historical data.)


---

14) Evaluation & acceptance tests (MVP)

Build a labeled test set of ~5k historical cases covering known, cluster-match, and new cases.

Metrics target for MVP:

Automation rate ≥ 50%

Automation Precision ≥ 90% for auto-assigned known issues

Mean time to issue creation reduced by 60%


Acceptance tests:

For every auto-assigned known-issue, check KIDB linkage correctness.

For cluster assignment, validate centroid updates & member counts.




---

15) MVP rollout plan (practical steps)

1. Data prep: export historical SRs, KIDB signatures, clusters. Build gold-labeled set.


2. Implement Feature Extractor + deterministic signature rules.


3. Deploy vector index & similarity search. Use pre-trained embedding model (sentence-transformer) for text+log snippets.


4. Implement Decision Engine with thresholds & explainability bundle.


5. Integrate Review UI & workflow; start with manual review for all cases for a short period (calibrate).


6. Gradually enable auto-assign at conservative thresholds, monitor Precision and Human overrides.


7. Iterate: tune weights/thresholds, add more features (structured device telemetry) and retrain.




---

16) Risks & mitigations

Noisy logs → low embedding quality: Mitigate with robust log parsing, token filters, enrich with structured metadata.

Model drift: Monitor drift indicators and keep retraining cadence.

Over-automation (bad auto-assign): Keep strict audit trail and allow mass rollback/merge of clusters.

Scalability of vector index: Choose managed or horizontally scalable vector DB.



---

17) Quick checklist for engineers (what to build first)

[ ] CaseSignature JSON schema finalized.

[ ] Deterministic rules engine for exact matches.

[ ] Feature extraction pipeline & embedding model selection.

[ ] Vector index (FAISS/Milvus) and APIs to query nearest neighbors.

[ ] Decision Engine with threshold config and explainability outputs.

[ ] Cluster Store + Cluster Updater service.

[ ] Review UI with accept/reject/merge.

[ ] Audit logs + model metadata tracking.

[ ] Metrics dashboard (automation rate, precision, review backlog).



---

If you want, I can:

produce a detailed sequence diagram in ASCII or Mermaid for this flow,

provide pseudocode or a small code snippet for the decision engine, or

draft the CaseSignature JSON schema and the Cluster DB schema ready for engineers.


Which of those would you like next?

11) Scalability & reliability

Stateless Decision Router + stateful Issue Store (DB).

Use event-bus for downstream orchestration and retries.

Store large attachments in object storage with signed URLs.

Circuit-breakers: if CAM unavailable, queue actions and notify fallback teams.



---

12) Example flows

Flow A — Known Issue, low severity (auto handled)

Decision = KNOWN_ISSUE, confidence 0.93 → Decision Router creates IssueRecord (auto), updates KIDB (increment AFR), sends daily summary to owner. No manual approvals. CA = software config change pushed via OTA. CA verification auto-confirms after telemetry window → Issue closed.


Flow B — New Cluster, high severity (human-in-loop)

Decision = NEW_CLUSTER, confidence 0.72 → routed to Field Ops + HW Eng, containment steps triggered (ship hold), RCA case created. Engineering proposes CA (design change). CAB approval required → rollout plan → verification fails in lab → issue escalated, cluster flagged urgent, vendor engaged.



---

13) Auto-feedback & learning

When issue closed, publish labeled outcome to training store:

case_id, final_decision, CA_outcome, timestamps, attachments.


Use this to re-train Cluster 2 models, update thresholds, and enrich KIDB signatures.



---

14) MVP checklist (what to build first)

[ ] Decision Router + IssueRecord schema and persistence.

[ ] Basic IssueRecord generator template + KIDB update adapter.

[ ] Notification engine (email/Slack) and SLA tracker.

[ ] CA Manager stub (create/assign/track tasks).

[ ] Verification pipeline hook (manual for MVP, automated later).

[ ] Dashboard with open issues and CA progress.

[ ] Audit store & RBAC.



---

15) Risks & mitigations

Poor CA verification data → require manual sign-off until telemetry is reliable.

Approval bottlenecks → escalate via on-call rotation and SLA alerts.

Incorrect automated containment → keep conservative auto-actions; require confirmation for high-impact actions.



---

If you'd like, I can:

produce a Mermaid sequence diagram showing Cluster 2 → Cluster 3 handover and CA lifecycle, or

draft the IssueRecord JSON schema and a sample RCA PDF template for engineers to use.


Which deliverable should I create next?





-----------------

Nice — below is a complete architecture and a concrete, executable plan for building the entire RMA VFA agent system inside a single Jupyter notebook. It maps components → data flow → DB schemas → agent responsibilities → Langsmith tracing → tooling choices and then gives a cell-by-cell implementation plan you can copy/paste into the notebook and run.

I kept it practical and minimal while production-minded: you’ll be able to split the notebook into files later with the same logic.

Architecture (high level)

We will implement the system as 3 agent clusters (what we already designed), plus supporting services (DB, vector index, prompt registry, langsmith tracing). Each agent cluster is implemented as a set of pure Python functions / classes within the notebook and orchestrated by a single run_pipeline() function.

Flow:

SR / Logs / Notes → Cluster 1 (Intake & Validation) → validated CaseSignature → Cluster 2 (Issue Creation Agent) → Decision (KNOWN / CLUSTER / NEW / REVIEW) + optional KnownIssueSignature → Cluster 3 (Decision & Reporting) → IssueRecord (persist to DB, produce report, trigger notifications).

We’ll trace each major step to Langsmith (one run per cluster invocation), and use a local vector index (FAISS / Chroma) for similarity.

Components & responsibilities

1. Notebook top-level / environment

Load .env, set keys (GROQ_API_KEY, LANGSMITH_API_KEY).

Initialize LLM (ChatGroq) and embedding model.

Initialize logger.



2. Schemas

Pydantic models (CaseSignature, Decision, KnownIssueSignature, Cluster, IssueRecord).



3. Prompt registry

Small dict with prompt templates and versions.

Jinja2 rendering helper.



4. DB layer

SQLite via SQLAlchemy for persistence (tables: issues, signatures, clusters, cases).

Helper functions: save_issue, save_signature, get_signatures, get_clusters, save_case_history.



5. Vector index

FAISS (or Chroma/Chromadb) to store embeddings for signatures & clusters.

Also store embeddings in DB for durability.



6. Cluster 1: Intake & Validation

intake_agent(raw_sr) -> CaseSignature

validator_agent(case_signature) -> (pass/fail, reasons)

Normalization, timestamping, evidence quality score.



7. Cluster 2: Issue Creation Agent

Deterministic rule matching (error codes, exact signature hash).

Embedding-based Known-Issue matching.

Cluster similarity engine with thresholds and explainability.

Creates/updates cluster and may output new KnownIssueSignature.



8. Cluster 3: Decision & Reporting

Builds IssueRecord per Issue Template (fields from screenshot).

Persists issue; triggers containment actions (stub); generates NL summary via LLM.

Handles human-in-loop (if Decision == REVIEW_REQUIRED).



9. Langsmith tracing

Each cluster call logs inputs/outputs and prompt used; store run_id in Audit table.



10. Utilities

Audit store, model metadata, config settings.




DB Schema (recommended SQLite via SQLAlchemy)

tables

signatures (known issue signatures)

id (uuid), name, device_types (json), error_codes (json), signature_hash, embedding (BLOB or base64), afr (float), notes, created_at, updated_at


clusters

id (uuid), name, centroid_embedding, members_count, status, created_at, last_updated, meta(json)


issues

issue_id (uuid), cluster_id, name, status, first_seen, last_seen, summary, customer_symptoms, impacted_pids (json), sn_list (json), predicted_afr, owner, created_by, created_at, updated_at


cases (case history)

case_id, issue_id (nullable), case_signature (json), decision (json), langsmith_run_id, timestamp


audit (optional)

id, event_type, payload, timestamp



Use ORM models in notebook to read/write. SQLite is fine for notebook; later swap to Postgres.

Known Issue Signature template (fields)

signature_id

signature_name (LLM generated short name)

signature_hash (deterministic hash of canonical tokens & error codes)

device_types (list)

error_codes (list)

canonical_examples (list of case ids)

embedding (vector)

afr_estimate (optional)

status: active / deprecated

created_by, created_at


Similarity & thresholds (startpoints)

deterministic exact signature match => immediate KNOWN (confidence 0.98)

known-issue semantic threshold: cosine ≥ 0.85 => KNOWN (auto)

cluster auto-assign threshold: cosine ≥ 0.80 => CLUSTER_MATCH (auto)

review window: 0.60 ≤ sim < 0.85 or high-impact cases => REVIEW_REQUIRED

new cluster creation for sim < 0.60


Langsmith integration plan

Create a run per cluster call. Log:

input case signature

prompt id & prompt text (from registry)

LLM outputs, embeddings, similarity scores, nearest neighbors

decision & confidence


Save the run_id in cases audit row.


Human-in-loop

If a case needs review, notebook will:

Print details and proposed action.

Provide a small interactive prompt (input() or display widget) for accept/reject/merge.

Save reviewer decision to DB.



Security / Config

Use .env in notebook (load via python-dotenv). Never print keys.

Implementation plan — cell-by-cell in one Jupyter notebook

Each cell is numbered and describes exact code/behavior to implement. I also include small code snippets and explanations so you can paste them into notebook cells.


---

Cell 1 — Notebook metadata & installation (one-time)

Comments + optional shell commands (use !)

# Cell 1: Install dependencies (run only once in notebook environment)
# Uncomment and run if packages aren't installed.
# !pip install python-dotenv sqlalchemy aiosqlite sqlalchemy-utils pydantic langchain langsmith sentence-transformers faiss-cpu numpy jinja2


---

Cell 2 — Imports & Logging

import os
import logging
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from datetime import datetime
import json
import uuid
import numpy as np

# recommended logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format="%(asctime)s %(levelname)s %(message)s")
logger = logging.getLogger("rma-vfa")


---

Cell 3 — Load env & initialize LLM + embeddings

load_dotenv()  # loads .env in notebook directory
GROQ_API_KEY = os.getenv("GROQ_API_KEY")
LANGSMITH_API_KEY = os.getenv("LANGSMITH_API_KEY")

if not GROQ_API_KEY:
    raise ValueError("Set GROQ_API_KEY in .env")

# Initialize the Groq LLM wrapper - pseudo code (adjust to your Groq SDK)
# Example (from your screenshot style):
from langchain import OpenAI  # replace with actual Groq Chat wrapper when installed
# If you use the official groq binding, replace this block accordingly.
# For notebook dev, we will stub calls if SDK is unavailable.

# Example embedding model init: sentence-transformers (local)
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
embed_model = SentenceTransformer("all-MiniLM-L6-v2")  # small and fast for notebook

logger.info("LLM and Embeddings initialized (embedding model ready).")

> Note: If you have a Groq SDK / ChatGroq class available, instantiate it here and keep LLM calls later. For now, we use embedding model for similarity and will call LLM via the Groq wrapper when generating summaries or prompts.

result = run_pipeline(sample_sr)
print(json.dumps(result, indent=2, default=str))

This runs end-to-end in the notebook and prints outputs.

Cell 15 — Unit tests & verification

Add a few simple assertion cells to validate functionality (e.g., deterministic match works, DB row created). Use pytest or inline asserts.


---

Cell 16 — Visualization & mermaid diagram (optional)

Render small mermaid or textual flow for reporting.

Execution checklist & timeline (one-notebook)

1. Install deps (Cell 1).


2. Configure .env (GROQ_API_KEY, LANGSMITH_API_KEY).


3. Run Cells 2..7 to prepare models & DB.


4. Run Cells 8..12 to prepare vector index and agent functions.


5. Run run_pipeline() (Cell 14) on sample inputs.


6. Inspect DB (sqlite3 rma_vfa.db or via SQLAlchemy) to confirm rows.


7. Iterate on thresholds and add real LLM calls (Groq) for prompt-based name generation and explainability.



Notes & Next steps after notebook MVP

Replace LLM stubs with real Groq calls once SDK available (in Cells where LLM used).

Replace FAISS in-memory index with persistent vector DB for production.

Add Langsmith SDK calls to replace langsmith_trace stub.

Add robust error handling, retries, and logging.

Add concurrency (async) if processing many SRs.

Add CI tests and a script to extract notebook cells into modules.


Memory update

I already saved your high-level project preferences. I also captured that we must include the Issue Template and Known Issue Signature template and a DB. I’ll keep that memory item up-to-date as we progress — e.g., when we implement DB and prompt registry I’ll update memory with relevant progress notes when you ask me to persist state.


---

If you want now, I’ll generate the actual code for Cells 2–7 (imports, env, embedding init, schemas, prompt registry, DB models), paste them as runnable notebook cells, and we’ll run them step-by-step. Which cell set do you want me to output first?
